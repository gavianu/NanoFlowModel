# NanoFlowModel

This repository documents the theoretical background, experiments, and conceptual development of the **NanoFlowModel** project â€” a research-oriented initiative to explore how geometry and material design can convert microscopic thermal chaos into structured motion.

## Key Themes

- Brownian motion and its manipulation
- Passive directional bias from geometry (entropic design)
- Fractal-inspired and biological fluid dynamics
- Link to theoretical models: Brownian ratchet, entropic barrier systems

## Related Simulation Code

The simulations and code are hosted in separate repositories:

- ðŸ”¬ [`vortex-box-test`](https://github.com/gavianu/vortex-box-test.git) â€“ Brownian cube prototype
- ðŸ”„ [`flow-bias-walls`](#) â€“ Next step: asymmetric walls and trapping
- ðŸ§¬ [`fractal-tube-model`](#) â€“ In development: biologically inspired geometries
