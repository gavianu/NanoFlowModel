# NanoFlowModel

**NanoFlowModel** is a scientific documentation project exploring how geometry and nanostructures can convert chaotic Brownian motion into directional or localized effects — without external energy input.

The goal is to understand whether carefully engineered environments (e.g., fractal or horn-shaped microchannels) can structure thermal noise, and potentially lead to new energy-harvesting or propulsion mechanisms for small-scale systems.

This repository contains only the documentation and theoretical framework for the project. Experimental code is maintained in separate simulation repositories.
