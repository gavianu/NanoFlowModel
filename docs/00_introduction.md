# Introduction

NanoFlowModel explores whether structured environments can produce net motion or energy alignment from random Brownian motion — **without external energy inputs**.

The idea is inspired by biological systems (intestines, blood vessels), and scientific concepts like the **Brownian ratchet**, **entropic traps**, and **thermal noise rectification**.

This project is also a philosophical and engineering exploration: can "design alone" act as an ordering mechanism for chaos?
