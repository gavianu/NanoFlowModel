# Future Development Plan

## Short-term Goals

- Export motion data to CSV for external analysis
- Introduce voxel-based entropy measurement
- Simulate geometries with tube-like channels (intestine-like)

## Long-term Vision

- Demonstrate a net flow model that replicates propulsion-like behavior
- Apply fractal geometries to test multi-scale directional bias
- Explore physical prototyping via microfluidic chips

## Questions

- Can passive asymmetry sustain energy gradients?
- What limits exist on scale, power, and reversibility?
