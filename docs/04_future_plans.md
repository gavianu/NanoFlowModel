# Future Development Plan

## Short-term Goals

- Export motion data to CSV for external analysis
- Introduce voxel-based entropy measurement
- Simulate geometries with tube-like channels (intestine-like)

## Long-term Vision

- Demonstrate a net flow model that replicates propulsion-like behavior
- Apply fractal geometries to test multi-scale directional bias
- Explore physical prototyping via microfluidic chips

## Questions

- Can passive asymmetry sustain energy gradients?
- What limits exist on scale, power, and reversibility?

## ‚úÖ Application Conclusion ‚Äì Test003: Heat Drift Geometry

The experiment `Test003 ‚Äì Heat Drift with Exit` validates the hypothesis that a 3D space with **passive wall asymmetry** can naturally induce thermal particle drift without requiring external energy inputs.

üî¨ The simulation results show a **statistical accumulation of particles** toward the top-right corner, where an exit zone ("chimney") is located. This dynamic confirms that **spatial geometry design** can guide Brownian motion in a predictable and controlled manner.

## üè† Market Relevance: Smart Home / Tiny House

‚úîÔ∏è This principle can be translated into a **passive thermal control product**, integrable in:

- **RVs and camper vans**
- **Tiny houses / modular off-grid homes**
- **Smart tent fabrics or outdoor enclosures**

üå°Ô∏è By using **walls with different properties** (reflective / absorbent), warm air can be passively guided to thermal exhaust zones without fans or electricity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps and Prototyping

- **Smart Passive Wall Cooling**: Test004 demonstrates how a treated wall surface can induce particle drift outward, reducing thermal load on structures like rooftops, terraces, or camper walls ‚Äî potential for self-regulating fa√ßade coatings.
- Physical prototype using **nanotube arrays** or **differentially treated fabrics**
- Integration into passive HVAC or micro-cooling circuits
- Optimization for **renewable energy systems** or **micro propulsion units**
