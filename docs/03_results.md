# Experimental Results Summary

| Test # | Description         | Net Flow  | X̄ Position | Notes                         |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| 001    | Uniform cube        | None      | ~0.0000 m  | Baseline for Brownian chaos   |
| 002    | Dual-wall asymmetry | Rightward | ~+0.03 m   | Passive entropic accumulation |

### Interpretation

The results suggest that **directional accumulation** can occur in completely random systems when **geometric or material asymmetries** are present — a principle that could lead to energy guiding or harvesting systems at the nanoscale.
