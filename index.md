# 🔬 NanoFlowModel — Scientific Research Hub

This repository documents the development of **NanoFlowModel**, a theoretical and experimental framework exploring whether Brownian motion can be geometrically biased and harvested for directional energy and motion — with implications in smart environments, passive cooling, and nano-propulsion systems.
