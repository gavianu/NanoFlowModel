## 📚 Structure

### 🧭 00 – [Introduction](./docs/00_introduction.md)

A conceptual overview of the hypothesis: transforming chaotic motion into directional flow using geometry alone.

### 🔬 01 – [Physics Context](./docs/01_physics_context.md)

Foundations of Brownian motion, statistical mechanics, ratchet theory, and thermodynamic analogies including Bernoulli and Navier–Stokes principles.

### 🧪 02 – [Experiment Log](./docs/02_experiment_log.md)

Step-by-step simulations including:

- Test001: Uniform Brownian Box
- Test002: Dual-Wall Asymmetry
- Test003: Heat Drift Geometry (Smart Cooling)

### 📊 03 – [Results](./docs/03_results.md)

Summary tables, plots and analysis of particle drift, mean position over time, and emergence of directional behavior.

### 🚀 04 – [Future Plans & Applications](./docs/04_future_plans.md)

Proposed applications in passive cooling, nano-energy harvesting, and sustainable home design. Includes roadmap toward prototyping and academic publishing.
