## Abstract

This thesis explores the possibility of extracting order from thermal noise by designing structured nano-geometries. Inspired by biological systems and theoretical models of entropic transport, this research evaluates the potential of passive geometries to produce flow bias or energy directionality at microscale.

## Conclusion

The preliminary results demonstrate spatial particle accumulation purely from asymmetric boundary interactions. This supports the hypothesis that local entropy reduction is possible by intelligent design alone, without violating thermodynamic laws.

Further simulation and nano-engineering steps are needed to approach practical energy or propulsion prototypes.
